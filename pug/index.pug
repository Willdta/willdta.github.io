      | by the previous content, everything must come to an end. now a little about me before we part ways (you can
      | always revisit though so don't be so sad).`

      p `I love designing and developing gorgeous websites (like the one you are
      | viewing right now), with my favourite tools ${skills}. i consider myself a minimalist (notice the color choices?)
      | and i believe that the most pleasing websites are the most simple and user friendly ones.`


      p `ok, enough about coding... what do ilike to do outside of development? well a couple of things, since you so kindly asked: 
      | [ 'Working out', 'playing with my little cute chihuahua','biking', 'netflix', 'going on long walks (on the bach preferably)' ]`


      p `and that my friends is the end. i hope you noticed how i incorporated javascript syntax throughout this site.
      | as i was developing my brain was telling me how unique and different that would be and though i'm not crazy,
      | i told my brain that he was right (he because i'm a male) and went ahead and tried my best.


      p `by the way, these are back ticks not quotes so if you were wondering why i used dollar signs and curly braces, now
      | you know. if you still have no idea, click here and google will explain. and yes, there's no capitilzation because it looks
      | very artsy without them.`
